# This file is an example of a descriptor file used by the command-line application FAdd.exe. The application is designed to 
# add disease features to radiographic imagery whose pixel elements are stored in an integer format that is directly proportional
# to exposure (NOT LOG EXPOSURE).
#
# NOTES:
# 1.) The pixel values of the input image must be 2-byte non-negative integer values.
# 2.) The values of the tags INPUT_BYTE_ORDER and OUTPUT_BYTE_ORDER must be set to 0 to indicate PC Intel microprocesser architecture or it can
#     be set to 1 for RISC based architecture which is prevalent on most UNIX boxes.
# 3.) Currently the value of the tag FEATURE_TYPE must be Nodule, the only currently supported diseasefeature.

# Notes for the lung nodule:
#  A) Lateral feature size typically on the order of10-30mm
#  B) Attenuation of 0.0376 per mm was given as a reasonable approximation of the linear attenuation coeficient
#     of a thin sheet of teflon for a DN-9 beam
#  C) Circular objects are the norm, thus, the aspect ratio is generally 1.0 and rotation (in radians) may 
#     generally be set to 0.0.
#  D) Smooting sigma is usually necessary to blend or feather the nodule into the background. Without smoothing,
#     the feature may exhibit ringing after frequency processing. The smoothing factor will generally need to 
#     increase in regions where there is litte relative x-ray attenuation.
#  E) Thickness represents the maximum thickness of the nodule, it is typically 5-6 mm.
